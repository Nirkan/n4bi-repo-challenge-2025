# Project planning and material repository for the 2025 repository challenge 

We invite everybody to contribute to this challenge by providing data sets to be uploaded to a variety of bioimaging repositories. Each participant should know the data well (=good annotations) and submit the same data set to at least two different databases listed [here](https://fairsharing.org/search?q=imaging&isRecommended=true&page=1).

The aims of this challenge are: **(i)** to learn which issues you encounter when uploading data, **(ii)** how to prepare yourself / your data better for this process, e.g. which metadata / data formats are required, **(iii)** have examplary data sets for reuse / re-analysis e.g. via galaxy and for testing new tools and **(iv)** get ready for the "close to real life" repo-challenge 2.0. 

We ask each participant to provide an overview in the table below which data sets and repos will be used. In case you need help from a data steward please write to the [helpdesk](https://nfdi4bioimage.de/help-desk/). In addition, a questionnaire will be provided (under construction, link will follow) to share the experience. A short summary about this challenge is also available on [zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14833974). 

**Time line**

+ Feb 2025: please enter your contribution in the table below as soon as possible

+ March 2025: open exchange meeting via zoom

+ May 30th 2025: data should be uploaded, accepted and publicly available

+ June 15th 2025: return questionnaire

+ June 2025: wrap-up & open exchange meeting via zoom - planning of repo2.0
